					<h2><a name="Scope">1.1 Scope</a></h2>
					<p>UPOD (Undergraduate Physics Online Database) is a website designed to the students with information about physics. The goal is to provide accurate and up to date physics knowledge for undergraduate students. There are currently very few quality physics reference sites, so UPOD has the opportunity to fill a large gap facing physics students at present.</p>

			<div id="mainHeading">

				<h3><a name="Product Perspective">2.1 Product Perspective</a></h3>
				<p>Integrating physics research and information into the new UPOD website, will be much more interactive and will be much more user friendly as well as containing much more relevant information to the topics covered. UPOD&rsquo;s implementation of the equations and other features will be done in collaboration with the MathJax team, Animations team, and Front-end team, as the functionality and availability of the physics information will only be made available and interactive through these other teams.</p>

				<h3><a name="System Interfaces">2.1.1 System Interfaces</a></h3>
					<p>Operates on the modern and standard browsers, including Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge.</p>

				<h3><a name="User Interfaces">2.1.2 User Interfaces</a></h3>
					<p>The Front-end team is responsible for the overall design and functionality of the UPOD website. This involves UI/UX implementation and developing guidelines for other teams to follow when designing assets for the website. UPODs MathJax team will create the physics equations as assets to be implemented into the website and shown to students. The Graphics and Animations teams will be responsible for developing the diagrams, and animated assets of the website. They will follow any guidelines given by the Front-end team and match the physics requirements set out by the Physics team.</p>

				<h3><a name="Software Interfaces">2.1.3 Software Interfaces</a></h3>
					<p>A database will be used by the entire UPOD team to store and organize data. In the database, relevant information will be linked together and will be able to include various information, equations, as well as any interactive models or information that can be used by the user to help them learn more about the subject.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Include various equations regarding the certain aspect of physics</li>
						<li>Ensure that information is not redundant and stored only once</li>
						<li>Include information and brief descriptions involving the aspect of physics</li>
						<li>Improve the linkage between any physics information so that they can be used in unison with one another</li>
					</ul>

				<h3><a name="Communications Interfaces">2.1.4 Communications Interfaces</a></h3>
					<p id="categoryHeading">Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</p>
					<li id="subcategoryHeading">HTTP is the underlying protocol used by the World Wide Web, which is a set of rules for transferring files.</li>

				<h3><a name="Memory">2.1.5 Memory</a></h3>
					<li>Is Memory relevant to physics information (the only problem would be exactly how to store all the phyiscs information and how much can be stored in linkage with ones that are related)</li>
					<li> Most of the physics information is stored on Github for the time being which serves as a central database that contains all the data relevant to the 6 topics of physics that are covered by the UPOD website. </li>

				<h3><a name="Constraints">2.4 Constraints</a></h3>
					<li>There might be too much information to include regarding the 6 aspects of physics as information regarding physics is vastly large and infinite and continuously growing</li>
					<li>The budget of UPOD is zero, so any software must be free to use.</li>
