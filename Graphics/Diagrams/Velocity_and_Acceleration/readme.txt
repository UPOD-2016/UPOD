Diagram: Velocity and Acceleration Car Diagram

Status: I have been able to animate the movement of one of the cars, and now I am working on getting the other two cars to move at the same time as the first one.

File descriptions: 
     1. cars.html: This file creates the images for the cars
     2. cars.js: This file uses velocity to animate the movement of the first car
