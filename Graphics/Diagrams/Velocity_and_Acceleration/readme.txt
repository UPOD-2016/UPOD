Diagram: Velocity and Acceleration Car Diagram

Status: I have animated the three cars and now I just have to add in a description about the acceleration and velocity of each of the cars

File descriptions: 
     1. cars.html: This file creates the images for the cars
     2. cars.js: This file uses velocity to animate the movement of the first car
     3. style.css: This file contains all of the styling for the buttons
