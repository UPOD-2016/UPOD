Diagram: Elastic Potential Energy Bow Diagram
Status: I have created a potential energy bow diagram that can move at the click of a button. I am currently working on having the potential energy value change as the bow is moved and also being able to click and drag the bow.
File descriptions:
  1. bow.html: this file creates all of the images and text for the bow diagram
  2. bow.js: this file has the functions that are called when either of the buttons are pushed to move the bow
