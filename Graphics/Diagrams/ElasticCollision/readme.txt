Diagram: Elastic Collision
Status: In process of creating a diagram that displays an elastic collision between two balls. inputs will be mass1,mass2, initial velocity 1, initial velocity 2. outputs will be final velocity 1, final velocity 2. There will also be an animation that displays the balls and their movement before and after collision
