Diagram: Elastic Potential Energy Bow Diagram

Status: I have created a potential energy bow diagram that can move at the click of a button. 

File descriptions:
  1. bow.svg: this file creates all of the images and text for the bow diagram
  2. bow.js: this file has the functions that are called when the buttons are pushed to move the bow
  3. style.css: this file contains all of the styling for the buttons
