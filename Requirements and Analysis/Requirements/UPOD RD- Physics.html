					<p>UPOD (Undergraduate Physics Online Database) is a website designed to the students with information about physics. The goal is to provide accurate and up to date physics knowledge for undergraduate students. There are currently very few quality physics reference sites, so UPOD has the opportunity to fill a large gap facing physics students at present.</p>
