Diagram: Free Body Diagram

Status: I have created a free body diagram with a button that will display the forces acting on the object and another button to hide these forces

File descriptions:
  1. free_body.svg: this file creates all of the images and text for the free body diagram
  2. freebodymovement.js: this file has the functions that are called when either of the buttons are pushed
  3. styles.css: this file contains all of the styling for the buttons
