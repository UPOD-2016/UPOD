Diagram: Distance vs. Displacement

Status: I have created a diagram that shows the difference between distance and displacement by traversing two points on a rectangle 

File descriptions:
     1. points.html: This file creates the images for the rectangle and its different components
     2. points.js: This file uses velocity to animate the movement from point A to B
     3. style.css: This file contains all of the styling for the buttons
